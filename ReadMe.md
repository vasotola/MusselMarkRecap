## Data files
Surveys included three secondary sampling dates within each of 5 primary sampling events at **upper** and **lower** sites in the river.

#### Upper Site
<b>`data_SITE_tags.csv`</b> Floy and PIT tag IDs associated with individual mussels at upper site.

<b>`data_SITE_floy.csv`</b> Floy tag detections at upper site. 

<b>`data_SITE_pit.csv`</b>  PIT tag detections at upper site. 

#### Lower Site
<b>`data_alt_tags.csv`</b> Floy and PIT tag IDs associated with individual mussels at lower site.

<b>`data_alt_floy.csv`</b> Floy tag detections at upper site keyed to `floy_id` in `data_alt_tags.csv`. 

<b>`data_alt_pit.csv`</b>  PIT tag detections at upper site keyed to `floy_id` in `data_alt_tags.csv`.
